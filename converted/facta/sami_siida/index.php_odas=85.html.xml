<p xml:lang="eng">Hi Krista,Actually it is not true that all field hockey scrohalships are taken once you are a senior. All coaches recruit differently, they may not be finished with recruiting until the last minute. It also depends on which division level you are aiming towards. Division I coaches are going to be harder to get a hold of, but you can expand your opportunities by reaching out to NAIA colleges and NCAA DII and DIII. Have you thought about which colleges you would like to attend? Reaching out to college coaches before your senior year is ideal, so the sooner you make an impression the better. Please let me know if you have any other recruiting questions or are ready to learn about connecting with coaches I"ll be happy to help.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Dear Chris, Thank you for your comment. As you are alrdaey aware, your son should be playing on a travel or AAU team this summer and next summer, as well as attending camps. What team and camps he chooses really depends on the colleges he wants to go to. First figure out which schools he is interested in. Then put together an athletic and academic resume, and contact the coaches at those schools. Find out from them what camps and AAU tournaments they will be attending. Then sign up for those camps, or research what AAU/travel teams will be playing in the tournaments those coaches mention.Going to a camp or a tournament is not enough to get recruited. There are a lot of athletes in attendance at these events, so coaches will scout the athletes they are alrdaey familiar with- that is why it is so important to make initial contact well before your son attends. Since you need to contact them anyway, it is a great opportunity to ask them the best ways to be able to play in front of them. If you want to discuss this more, feel free to email me at .Regards,Andrew Bruno</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">the best thing you can do is begin contacting caheocs at other programs. I would recommend starting with caheocs at the schools nearest FSU that you might be interested in. When you contact caheocs, you ware going to want to be able to send them film, if you don"t have game film, get film of you running through drills at full speed. If you can, find when open gym hours are at other schools and find out where the basketball players for those schools play and play with them. If you prove yourself in those games you will find a way to get on the team. Good luck.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I am a 6"3 guard currently adnetting FIU. I enrolled last semester with high hopes of making the team by walk-on. However, they cancelled the walk on tryouts so i was unable to do so. I played basketball for more than 10 years back in the Caribbean where i was averaging 20.2 ppg just before i moved to Florida. I am confident that i have the talent to make the team but now i"m thinking that the door" is closing on me because i am a international student (22 yrs).What should i do? is there a way i can get another school to recruit me? I appreciate your comments.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">My school is cordnseniig giving HS credit for Alg I in the 8th grade. To be eligible for this class a student would have had a advanced score on his state standarized test. Following completion of the course, he must have a end of course exam score of profiecient or advance to obtain the HS credit. My question is, If a student takes this class and scores proficient or advanced on the end of course exam, and receives HS credit, would NCAA accept this as a math credit? From my understanding the purpose in allowing the top eighth graders to take ALG I was so that they would have the ability to complete the advance math track of ALG I, Geometry, ALG II, TRIG/College ALG, and finally Calculus.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">You really suhldon"t have a problem (so long as your PT is up to Air Force/Navy par). It really depends, though, on what type of ROTC you"re interested in. If, say, you wanted to go to the Air Force Academy in CO or Annapolis, you need to get your butt in gear to find a government sponsor and you can select an option to receive information on scholarships. If you want to attend a civilian school, like UMass-Amherst (they have an AFROTC program (the only one I know of in the area!)) you need to speak with the ROTC program at the school. The scholarships offered by most ROTC programs are given out after the first semester of participation. However, I would strongly advise you do a little research to find an officer recruiter in your area and speak to him. They will have the answers with far more detail available for you.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Mr. Brodkey is so right that classrooms shodlun"t follow a one size fits all program. Each student is different so they learn differently; each teacher is different and therefore teach differently. One of M-A students" favorite things about our school is that each teacher is unique and provides a different experience, helping us figure out what does and doesn"t work. Also, a lot of teachers give us freedom in the way we learn, letting us experiment to find the best method.For example, while Cornell notes are a very practical way to take notes, I know very few people who use it and are happy with it. Many students never bother writing the summaries at the bottom or questions on the margins. By this time, students have gotten used to their own style of note-taking and their preference should be respected, especially since different class subjects" notes can be taken in different styles (i.e. history vs. math). Cornell note style is a good suggestion but it should be up to the student how to take the notes that they themselves will be using to study.Also, with equity cards, it is nice to give everyone the chance to answer questions and make sure they are paying attention, but again, this interferes with a students natural learning habits. There are certain people who like to stimulate their brains by answering questions but others take longer to formulate thoughtful answers. Some of the brightest students I know are those that hardly ever speak in class.Of course there are certain components of the DII program that are beneficial in many ways but M-A"s motto is strength in diversity, which includes diversity among the staff in their teaching style and ability to adapt to each class and each student.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I like that Brodkey took the matter into his own hands and aired his gercvanies against the DII program. It seems like many teachers teachers I"ve spoken with have expressed some sort of discontent with this program, and I"m glad that one teacher has finally decided that these concerns should be seen by the administration and those in charge of implementing these strategies.jpfau Reply:March 19th, 2013 at 8:05 pmI agree, I wonder if there"s anything we as students could do in this effort?</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">While I agree that teachers shluod not favor one type of personality over another and create a comfortable environment for all students, I think that in certain situations challenging a student to move outside his or her comfort zone is necessary for growth. This, of course, does not mean forcing shy students into a group environment in which they may be overshadowed, but rather encouraging shy students to come out of their shells by calling on them more often, thus increasing their confidence themselves.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">My school is coidrsening giving HS credit for Alg I in the 8th grade. To be eligible for this class a student would have had a advanced score on his state standarized test. Following completion of the course, he must have a end of course exam score of profiecient or advance to obtain the HS credit. My question is, If a student takes this class and scores proficient or advanced on the end of course exam, and receives HS credit, would NCAA accept this as a math credit? From my understanding the purpose in allowing the top eighth graders to take ALG I was so that they would have the ability to complete the advance math track of ALG I, Geometry, ALG II, TRIG/College ALG, and finally Calculus.</p>
