<p xml:lang="eng">What you should know:The bands have to pay to use the sound ssytem at Sound Stage. It"s not cheap, either. Nominally, they are paying the sound mixer guy, but rarely are the bands happy with the resulting sound mix they get. And bands aren"t allowed to use their own sound gear and mix it themselves.Yet the bands pay because it gives them a chance to perform in public. Several bands get together to lessen the cost for each, then they charge a small cover. What most often happens is the sound guy gets his money and the bands end up with nothing or in the hole. Meanwhile, Sound Stage does a lot business, profiting from the shows the bands put on.I think there has to be a better way, something more fair to the bands. At the very least they should be allowed to use their own equipment so they don"t have to pay Mr. Sound Guy.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">You need to determine how well done you would like each. If you are stirnatg out better to go a little longer. Once you get the feel experiment. Watch the chicken and burgers. They can be a little dangerous. For steaks, sear the outside good and let the center be as bloody as you like it.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">typically hotdogs are fully cokeod prior to buying. just grill them till warmed thru.Hamburgers should cook over slightly indirect heat to cook evenly. Anywhere from 5 minside and up depending on thickness and desired inside doneness (ie rare, med.rare, med., med.well, well, etc)chicken, definately over indirect heat for at least 7 minsidewith charcoal, pile in center, quick spray of lighter fluid or no fluid if you are using a coal chimney and newpaper to start fire. Wait until coals are red hot and ashy, then spread evenly unless indirect cooking area is desired, then pill them on one side.for the 2 wire rack situation, place the coals on the lower rack, this allows airflow for the fire to burn.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Danielle! What a blessing YOU are!!! Have I ever told you I am jeuoals because you get to live in the Cape? Haha just kidding! Kind of .anyway, it is so exciting that you picked that passage, because that is a passage that spoke volumes to me about 2 years ago. After my freshman year of college, the Lord called me to transfer to Carson-Newman to major in missions, and I had to leave EVERYTHING behind! And it is still disheartening sometimes when I see pictures of my friends back home (a 7-hour trip, so I don"t get to go home much) and how their lives are changing. But then I am reminded of how blessed I am even still. Yes, I have friends back home, but I have also met some AMAZING people at C-N and around the world! (Literally!) And, God is so good about giving one blessing that continues to give and bless us like the job I have at Samaritan House. I am SO BLESSED to get to live and work here! And it was not just a one-time blessing of getting the job and a free place to live, but it is a blessing that keeps on blessing ALL THE TIME!!! I am just so blessed!!! God loves us so much, and even when He calls us to leave everything behind, He continues to bless us in ways we never imagined. And He multiplies His blessings in our obedience. But never fear, the Lord has seen your sacrifice and the passion that you give to the Cape and to Living Hope. Never forget that! You are doing a GREAT JOB!!! A verse of Scripture that a precious friend shared with me not long ago is Hebrews 6:10 God is not injust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him as you have helped His people and continue to help them. God sees every huge and every tiny sacrifice that you are making, and with that, GOD IS PLEASED. He is dancing and singing over you, His precious daughter!! (Zeph. 3:17). You are so precious keep on running strong in the strength of the Lord! Blessings to you and to all my peeps in SA!!! Love you all,Michelle</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Danielle! What a blessing YOU are!!! Have I ever told you I am jeuoals because you get to live in the Cape? Haha just kidding! Kind of .anyway, it is so exciting that you picked that passage, because that is a passage that spoke volumes to me about 2 years ago. After my freshman year of college, the Lord called me to transfer to Carson-Newman to major in missions, and I had to leave EVERYTHING behind! And it is still disheartening sometimes when I see pictures of my friends back home (a 7-hour trip, so I don"t get to go home much) and how their lives are changing. But then I am reminded of how blessed I am even still. Yes, I have friends back home, but I have also met some AMAZING people at C-N and around the world! (Literally!) And, God is so good about giving one blessing that continues to give and bless us like the job I have at Samaritan House. I am SO BLESSED to get to live and work here! And it was not just a one-time blessing of getting the job and a free place to live, but it is a blessing that keeps on blessing ALL THE TIME!!! I am just so blessed!!! God loves us so much, and even when He calls us to leave everything behind, He continues to bless us in ways we never imagined. And He multiplies His blessings in our obedience.
