<p xml:lang="eng">ROFL! Joanna, I got excited about the conetst and then read the comments and fell apart with laughter at your quandary with the rating system. LOL! This is a wonderful idea and Lea will be a wonderful judge. I"ll have to put my thinking cap on for this one. Thanks for always inspiring us to write Joanna!Karen xx</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Lea Ann,Christmas is for the kids right??We do a cousins gift enxcahge (pull names so if you have 3 kids then all you buy is 3 gifts). As for the adults we play a white elephant style game.Nothing is to be bought, you have to find something laying around the house that is not TRASH but something you just don"t want or use.You wrap it up in a bag or box as pretty as can be to make it more appealing to someone else =)All the adults are handed a card from a deck, then the dealer has a different deck to pull from. As your card is called you go look at all the pretty boxes and bags and pick what one you want (cant open this round). After all the cards have been called and all the boxes/bags have been taken you do another round, this is the steal round , you go trade someone your bag for their bag then you open it, show it off and put it back in the bag/box after all cards are gone you do the last round where it gets FUN =)You have to remember what was in each bag/box and trade with someone if you want what they have, if you want to keep what you have then you just say keep . The object of the game in the last round is to be the last card called so you have the ultimate pick =)Good Luck!! Becky</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Good ideas.Yeah, a lot of glitter on the make-ups lately. It’s nice, I love heavy make-up, but pink isn’t your color in my opinion. Purple, black and wine red would be more suited to you. But as you say, it indeed depends a lot on the oufants.Thtiks for the follow ups, always appreciated</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I hear you all. Today, I recently revcieed this email from UK WEB:*******Dear XXXAs you probably know, UK WEB has ceased trading. You deserve some answers.It is with great regret that this occurred. Despite best efforts early in the year, we failed to serve our customers. Let alone Legendary Service that we once strived for.The remains of the hosting business was transfered to Heart Internet who will honour all of the hosting and most of domain accounts and expiry dates. Heart Internet are a very trust worthy, well funded and successful company and we know that they will do their best to help you.If you are one of the customers who have domain names with GoDaddy please send an email to We will transfer each and every domain to it"s rightful owner. Whilst I can"t guarantee a same day reply due to the volume of emails I will work on them every evening to help out all of you as best that I can.To those that held a hosting account during 2007, you will feel strongly let down and with good cause. You had become accustomed to a high level of service that we could not sustain. We worked hard to repair the damage that we bought into but in the end personal and financial circumstances meant that it fell into disrepair.To be fair to the previous owners, they must have encountered the same and we naively believed that we could rebuild and grow. We didn"t have the finances to weather the storms and we collapsed under the weight of it.Once again, you have our deepest apologises for the appalling services these last few months and wish you the very best with Heart Internet, or your new provider.*******Might be hogwash. I"ve not got my domain back. Ill report back to let you all know.</p>

You deserve some answers.It is with great regret that this occurred. Despite best efforts early in the year, we failed to serve our customers. Let alone Legendary Service that we once strived for.The remains of the hosting business was transfered to Heart Internet who will honour all of the hosting and most of domain accounts and expiry dates. Heart Internet are a very trust worthy, well funded and successful company and we know that they will do their best to help you.If you are one of the customers who have domain names with GoDaddy please send an email to We will transfer each and every domain to it"s rightful owner. Whilst I can"t guarantee a same day reply due to the volume of emails I will work on them every evening to help out all of you as best that I can.To those that held a hosting account during 2007, you will feel strongly let down and with good cause. You had become accustomed to a high level of service that we could not sustain. We worked hard to repair the damage that we bought into but in the end personal and financial circumstances meant that it fell into disrepair.To be fair to the previous owners, they must have encountered the same and we naively believed that we could rebuild and grow. We didn"t have the finances to weather the storms and we collapsed under the weight of it.Once again, you have our deepest apologises for the appalling services these last few months and wish you the very best with Heart Internet, or your new provider.*******Might be hogwash. I"ve not got my domain back. Ill report back to let you all know.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Thanks for the input Melissa and thanks for your surpopt! Balancing parenthood and creative/professional life is a topic that is CONSTANTLY on my mind! Balancing work and creativity is also an interesting challenge. The balancing act is tricky and I think that we can manage it best by being clear about our priorities . Can"t wait to write more about that one! I love your question as to how to write an effective bio/blurb as well. It is definitely challenging writing about ourselves although I think that you do an extraordinary job presenting yourself!*Melissa has just signed a contract to publish her first YA fiction novel!* Her book is absolutely brilliant! I am hoping that Melissa will do some guest posting for me because she knows how to make dreams come true!!xo Lea</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Good man! Self-imposed deadlines are a great idea I"d hang arnoud on social media all day without them!Having the same challenge as you own blog posts a bit thin on the ground as I juggle other projects including launching that new web site I mentioned. Aiming for December now but possibly January.I very much like the way you respect your readers by leaving short updates like this one always look forward to the latest news from you.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Hi Melissa! Welcome to the wonderful world of real esatte! That"s a great question for you to ask your RE Teacher. Also, are you planning on working with a large re company or an independent? My suggestion is start off with a business plan. Notify your sphere of influence .tell your family, friends, neighbors, so they will tell their family, friends, neighbors, etc., send out announcement cards, then follow up with phone calls to your sphere. Word of mouth is the best advertising and it"s free. Try to get a listing so you can meet buyers. If you can"t get a listing soon, offer to do as many open houses for other agents as you can. Get out there and network. Go after expireds and fsbo"s. Have many things going on at a time because wasting time means there"s a gap between paychecks. I have quite a few active buyers right now, some I have just recently met and others I have been showing properties to for the past 4 to 5 months and some longer. Anyway, typically, 45 days to closing and then you get paid. Good Luck .any questions, feel free to email!</p>
