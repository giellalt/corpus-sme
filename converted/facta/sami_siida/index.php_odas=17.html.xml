<p xml:lang="eng">Dear Sir/Madam, I am concerned about the reenct attacks on Homeopathy.Recently a group of peopletook large amounts of Homeopathic remedies.I do not understand the purpose of thisdemonstration because it does not prove anything.If it is to prove that the remedies have noaction it does not make sense because the remedies will only work on a particular personwith a particular illness with a particular remedy based on a legnthy consultation andgathering of all the symptoms the person has.But there demonstration only proved that homeop-athic medicines are safe.Still I would like to know exactly what this group was trying to door demonstrate.I also hear people criticize the suggestion of water having memory.I am notsure if this is true or not true but there is something that cannot be explained at themoment.There are many things that cannot be explained in fact there are many things that couldnot be explained at one time going back just a few hundred years or thousands of years.So at the moment stands the history of Homeopathy of two hundred years or so,used by the elite,people in important positions of office,as well as the ordinary people.Science cannot proveeverything at the moment.After all they are imperfect humans like everyone else but I do givethem credit as they have made many discoveries and they continue to do so. Coming up to thepresent day,if its good enough for the Queen,its good enough for us the ordinary people.Aperson should have the ability to choose if they want to use homeopathy or not.If a treatmentdoes not work for a person then that person will not keep going back for more.I recieve medicaltreatment from my GP and I also use homeopathy at times.I find that both provide me withbenefits.As for the placebo effect this I believe can happen with any kind of therapy eithernatural or otherwise.In fact there are many other therapies who`s benefits can`t be explainedbut homeopathy is the one that is picked out for the attacks.Correct me if I am wrong but theplacebo effect to occur requires an adult human being not a animal and not a child and also itrequires faith in the person providing the placebo and in the placebo itself whithout thereciever knowing that it is in fact a placebo.I dont` think I myself could get a placebo effectas I have taken medicines which I strongly believed would work particularly if I was seeing anew practitioner or a new therapy but I did not get the response I expected on the other handI have tried a new therapy or remedy whether homeopathic,pharmaceutical,or other treatment notbelieving it would work but it worked well to my surprise.I think to much credit is given tothe placebo effect.Yours SincerelyMr Balbir Harbias</p>
