<p xml:lang="eng">Dear Eoin, It was interesting to learn that An Daingean is tweind with Santa Barbara, CA. It is a beautiful city on the Pacific Ocean in southern California. Did you know that at this time of the year and through the summer Santa Barbara has fog much of the day?! Perhaps that explains their twining . We live in northern CA in the San Francisco area. SF, too, experiences fog during the summer but not the winter.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Fog makes everything seem quite mtiyersous, don"t you think? Your photos of the boat and the sunrise are both excellent. It"s so neat that you caught the sun right between those two trees, or are they bushes?.....I can"t really tell, but it does show your genius at what you do so well, picking your spot. Fog is good to look at but I certainly hate to drive in it. We don"t really have fog here in the desert, but when we go up north to visit our daughter, we often get fog. She lives near San Francisco. It can be very scary and dangerous too....we have had some pretty serious pile ups that we have fortunatley just missed, two or three, so hope you didn"t have to drive in dense fog.I haven"t blogged for almost three weeks, but I"m back now. I have just been so darned busy. We had three sets of company in that time and even though I love company, it can really wear me down. I likely won"t post much more often in the future, not because of being too busy, but there just isn"t anything that interesting to post about. I use my blog mostly as a journal and it"s not always that interesting to read someone else"s journal. I"m glad you come by though and I always love your remarks.

It"s so neat that you caught the sun right between those two trees, or are they bushes?.....I can"t really tell, but it does show your genius at what you do so well, picking your spot. Fog is good to look at but I certainly hate to drive in it. We don"t really have fog here in the desert, but when we go up north to visit our daughter, we often get fog. She lives near San Francisco. It can be very scary and dangerous too....we have had some pretty serious pile ups that we have fortunatley just missed, two or three, so hope you didn"t have to drive in dense fog.I haven"t blogged for almost three weeks, but I"m back now. I have just been so darned busy. We had three sets of company in that time and even though I love company, it can really wear me down. I likely won"t post much more often in the future, not because of being too busy, but there just isn"t anything that interesting to post about. I use my blog mostly as a journal and it"s not always that interesting to read someone else"s journal. I"m glad you come by though and I always love your remarks. What a lucky thing I ran into your blog...........Thanks Rune.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I adloniitadly believe that mesothelioma cancer is a unusual form of many forms of cancer that is usually found in individuals previously exposed to asbestos. Cancerous cells form inside the mesothelium, which is a safety lining which covers almost all of the body’s bodily organs. These cells generally form while in the lining of the lungs, abdominal area, or the sac which actually encircles the heart. Thanks for discussing your ideas.</p>
