<p xml:lang="eng">its the govenrments rlseonsabipity to create jobs?? I have a clue for you, its NOT. To blame the liberals for the governments not creating jobs is, well specious to the extreme. Conservatives government policy also has not created any jobs. There is absolutely NO proof the trickle down theory works, Its the governments job to create infrastructure, and maintain and enforce laws. Providing safety nets can arguably be considered falling under the umbrella of infrastructure just as education, and yes, health care. Bailing out big banks is about as much of governments job as bailing out individual homeowners, perhaps they shouldn"t have done it, and even more important, WHY did they bail out the banks without providing any assistance to homeowners who are STILL being gouged by predatory banking policies. Where the government failed is in not passing laws preventing the banks from issuing predatory loans to bad credit risks. That is, simply stated, loan sharking and should be illegal. Those executives who recieved bonus"s from TARP payments should sit in jail. In fact.. as prices and market values got unbelievably artificially elevated and the regulations were bypassede2â‚¬a6all to appease those who answered to a group of folks that should have never, ever been given a loane2â‚¬a6e2â‚¬a6(Andy"s specious assertion) Sorry to tell you this, but it had nothing to do with appeasing the average potential homebuyer, it was the bank lobby wanting to be allowed to loan shark. They BEGGED to be allowed to give credit to people who would spend the rest of their lives paying interest. You just Blamed the Victim in the most reprehensible way.. they have no political voice to solicit what you said they demanded.As to the entitlement programs, prove they have failed. Prove that Social Services is a failed program. I believe its a hugely successful safety net that keeps children and incompetant people from starving in the streets. You may not approve of spending tax dollars on it, but that doesn"t mean its failed. The same can be said about medicare, and social security. Show me where either of these has failed at this point. I cannot tell if I covered all the points you put in your rambling unstable post, but it was just off base. You really DO need to adjust your meds or stop posting when the liquid meds get too intense.</p>

Now the protector has lots of scratches on and I was about to replace that thing when i peeled it off I noticed that the phone has a protector itself? it doesn"t cover the whole phone it has a mm of extra space. I don"t know about the black ones, but this really is a screen protector? any iPhone experts over here? (FYI it"s not that thing that was placed on the ip4s when u first open it and you have to peel off the front and back part. I already peeled it off long time ago.)</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">This is irrelevant to the topic, but I will type sowlly . so you can undertand without moving your lips. It doesn"t matter how fast the water is moving, its the volume of the water that makes the crest, which is what causes the flood. The only difference flow makes is WHEN the crest hits the community. If the issue were blocking the water (as in dikeworks) THEN it would have relevance because then force comes to play for designing structural integrity, but thats not what we are talking about here, is it. We are talking about crest levels, and if the high point of the crest can be reduced to under flood stage, then catastrophic flood is avoided no matter how hard and fast it hits. Drain off enough water during Fargo"s crest, and the volume hitting Grand Forks will be less. I am not contesting that Island Park"s retention is a drop in the bucket, but if you have enough buckets it makes a difference. My thesis wasn"t about flood control, it was about good city design, and how to fix the bad design the Army Corps of Engineers implemented. By building the dike the way they did, they segmented Fargo"s Central Park into 3 marginally useful parks that you need to get into a car to access. I redesigned it so it once again became one elegant pedestrian park with water retention WHEN NEEDED, free access across 4th street without crossing traffic, and most importantly, stormwater processing through natural wetlands that have recreational uses such as canoeing, fishing and ice skating. Federal law has been passed that cities now have to clean the stormwater drainoff before its returned into the watershed and one way is to pass it through wetlands, so I restored the river bottom back into a series of finger lakes that the stormwater runs through before returning to the river. The flood control is only an peripheral consequence of good design, not the focus of the thesis. The cities meltwater can be retained until after the flood goes down and IF the crest reaches a dangerous point for Grand Forks, some can be drained off. You aren"t the one I need to prove the feasability to, so lets get back on topic and discuss REAL issues that matter instead of nit picking minor elements of a design you have never seen and have no actual clue about. Prove that a real scientist actually made a real study that proves that Liberals are more popular than Conservatives. Its your flakey source, and you only keep proving the neo con pundits brainwashed you.</p>

Hours to wait until the pool opened so I went to see the mess downtown. Sandbags covering the manhole covers to keep them weighted down, but they were leaking water onto the street. I think they had pumps set up to try to keep up with the water backing up out of them. It was a very damp, cold, shivery misery. I don"t think my shoes dried out for a week. An old guy lectured us about how to properly fill the sand bags Don"t fill them too much. There has to be some empty bag to interlock under the next bag laid. That way the wall is strong enough so that the water doesn"t break through the whole thing. Whenever I see news stories of floods anywhere with sandbags strewn in haphazard piles and water leaking everywhere I think of him.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">We are now enjoying the ftrius of the last 28 years of deregulation pressure from the right. Sure much of government is focused on stupid shit. Don"t get me started about OSHA. But to allow the private sector to police itself and be trusted to follow guidlines has been like telling a kid not to stick their hand in that cookie jar and walking away assuming it will still be full later.Unfortunately we are about to enter a new phase of over regulation because of idiots like the banks, the investment sector, the healthcare profession and yes, more federal involvement in anything concerning the environment. A more proactive approach is needed by government, but as these things go, they will most likely go way overboard. One extreme seems as bad as the other. Why we can"t hit that sensible middle ground is beyond me.</p>

It"s small and the pockets are hard to reach as well, but it takes zero effort to take it off, while running, get what you need and flip it back onto your back. It is lightweight, and I don"t even notice it"s there. I"ve been super lucky and haven"t had any chaffing either. :)</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I just received these cases today, and I like them a lot. I have the iPhone 4 on Sprint.PROS: Very prtety, simple, lightweight, inexpensive. They fit on the phone fine without covering buttons or anything. I used to have one of those rhinestoned cases for a big Android phone, and it was WAY too heavy + bulky. These, however, are perfect considering the back is flat and it still gives off a mirrory shimmer without being excessive. Also, having the extra cases and screen protectors are a nice precaution, and it"s not difficult to pull the case off of the phone if you want to change them out. I haven"t tried the screen protectors as I already had one.CONS: It"s not as durable as carbon fiber or Otterbox. Because they"re simple plastic cases like you"d get at a kiosk from the mall, they"ll still protect from fingerprints (w/ screen protector) and minor scratches, but won"t protect the front screen from being damaged if you drop it. (I think this is also a design issue; the whole phone is minimalistic. An added plastic cover surrounding the button &amp; speaker on the front may be distracting, so it seems like a lot of manufacturers exclude it &amp; only cover the back &amp; bumper on the phone.) The only other potential issue is the glitter being a little delicate, but a little hairspray or spray enamel (as if you"re sealing a drawing/painting) will probably keep it from coming off.Minor details, I got the 4 cases + two screen protectors for $5 from the seller eforcity, plus shipping it came out to $8. It took longer than a week to get here, but that would be the fault of USPS rather than the seller. This is a decent purchase overall. I"m giving one to a friend as gift as well, and I"m sure she"s going to love it.</p>

I know a fellow in Manchester and he"s been on high alert ready to kick some butt in case some dceides to go crazy on his flat.On a happier note I love tins also I"m using an old Christmas one for my patterns now too. I was using an old card box but I like how this tin is sturdy and BIG.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I was looking for a low cost suiltoon to protect the back of my IPad 3 and still be able to use the original Apple smart cover. After searching the amazon marketplace for the evening I decided to buy this silicone, Despite there yet to be any reviews on it .The item arrived in normal amazingly quick time, and was duly fitted to the IPad within half a minute ..Its lightweight, fits like a glove, smooth, clear and does not add any bulk. It has all the neccessary cut outs to be able to access all the features and does not obscure the camera lens, speaker etc. My Smart cover also fits exactly as before .What more could I need! It also came with a screen protector which was an added bonus.All in all a very good purchase does the job well, and cost less than other products on sale.</p>
