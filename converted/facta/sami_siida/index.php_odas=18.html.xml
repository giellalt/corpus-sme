<p xml:lang="eng">Good to hear from you Mike. I always know ealctxy what to write to get you to pipe up, right? Reasonable people can disagree on these rankings, but Syracuse did just lose AT HOME to Pitt by DOUBLE DIGITS. I understand the Kansas-Cornell analogy by we all know Kansas would beat Cornell 9 out of 10 times. That"s the definition of a fluke. Can we say that about Pitt-Cuse? I don"t think so. Let me see more and then I will adjust accordingly. As for West Virginia and Villanova, I"ve had them 1-2 in that order since October and I see no reason to change that right now. Nova losing to Temple in one of those crazy Big 5 games (where upsets are commonplace) doesn"t upset the apple cart in my mind. Again, it"ll all play out. I actually enjoyed Boeheim"s postgame after Seton Hall, even his potshot at the media about OOC schedule strength (at least the quotes were interesting and usable). Much better than the normal blah-blah-blah you get from a lot of the other guys. Bitter, the point about last year"s Big East is how it was the deepest league ever. Obviously no league was better at the top than those mid-80s Big Easts. If it makes you feel better the next time it comes up I will put an asterisk and a footnote making this distinction. Piratefocus,I"ve been beating the drums for Fero Hall as you know, but he is way too small to play center in the Big East. Have you seen the size of the postmen on the other teams? Big John is a space-eater and is useful in short spurts (alas, his knees have robbed him of the rest). Fero has to beef up big-time before he can hold his own at center for any reasonable lengths.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Best Presentation SecretsThis book impressed me with the idea of keniepg a simple focus â one message I can sell with elegance and enthusiasm to my audience. I learned that what my audience wants is much more than information, but a clear and reasonable solution to a problem they have, and the feeling of confidence that they can make it work for them. When I think of the few speakers who really got through to me, motivated me to do something different or to make a change, the techniques in this book certainly apply. I was also amazed at the ratio of preparation to performance, and that many hours of practice and preparation are required for a smooth, âeffortlessâ presentation. It makes me ask myself as a speaker, what do I know and believe in that can work for others? Can I communicate it in a way that speaks to the audienceâs most basic needs and desires? This book says, yes, you can!</p>

I think Lawrence and Theodore sharing the point guard position is just going to get better and better.The other position needing the change now is in the Center position. The UConn game shows proof again that Jon Garcia just isnt quick enough and doesnt have the Center moves to compete against the Centers in the Big East.Farrakon Hall is getting better and better and I think he should be sharing that position with Pope with Jeff Robinson coming to share the Power Forward Position with Pope. Then have Garcia come off the bench to deal with the oppositions bench Centers later in the game.He is just not Big East Good enough and is hurting the team. A couple of times you can see Garcia back away from positions underneath the basket where he could have made the easier rebound or block outs.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">I"m a fan of both sports and to say bnoxig fans are in a different class is just ignorant. It seems that the ignorant ones are a fraction (not all, as some bnoxig fans have knowledge) of the bnoxig fans. It"s not hard to see that they are two different sports. Just because it involves striking doesn"t make it the same. Kickbnoxig and bnoxig involve striking but are night in day besides that, different rules and options. There"s a long line because people are lined up to watch the event, to meet the fighters and participate in the whole experience. That"s what bnoxig has been missing for a long time. I miss those days when there was always a good bnoxig match on, now we have fighters ducking each other and having press conference wars instead of getting in the ring!</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">No Matter How the areas are decided, Quotes Chimp utilize their record-assembling capabilities to calculate the prices of vehicle insurance statements within each recognized area. The insurance market"s abstract thought for this particular prices mechanics is the reality that many injuries happen inside a number of kilometers of where the car is garaged. Therefore, the corporations genuinely believe that areas supply an exact foundation for pinpointing their threat.
