<p xml:lang="eng">The name and address of any witnesses. QuotesChimp is common for the participants in an accident to have differing versions, often self-serving ones at that, of how the collision occurred. This often leads to a situation where it is one driver"s word against the other"s. For this reason, it is vital that you obtain the names and addresses of witnesses to the mishap who can assist in determining what happened. This is important even if your company will pay benefits, since they have the right to sue the party at fault or his or her insurance company for reimbursement for the benefits paid. This kind of lawsuit is called subrogation.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Nina - luv your blogFYI - Safety was never made aware of the negotiations beewetn Plaintiff"s lawyer"s office and the out of state carrier until presented with a post settlement demand for payment of the atty. fees. Having put the carrier on notice of their subroagtion interests, the out of state carrier then put a stop payment on the initial check and reissued two checks - one to safety for their PIP and the remainder to Atty Yasi for the tort case. Subsequently, Atty. Yasi"s office asserted that Safety had interfered with his rights to the fee. The Court correctly saw otherwise.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Hello Rob. Thanks for the interest in the book. To be asbloutely clear, the book coming out on Sept 19th is the fourth edition of my PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide . I don"t really know anything about the pricing of it and I don"t have any electronic versions of it at all, to give away, to sell, or to read myself. In short, I have nothing to do with the actual selling. I sincerely thank you for the interest, though. As for your question regarding CActiveRecord property variables, if I understand your question correctly, you asbloutely do need property variables. I"m not sure what you mean by Form controls , but there are no form controls that provide any storage at all. As for your question about taking two models and assign values to PHP controls, I"m not sure what you"re asking, but it sounds like you"re asking about what the Yii framework will do automatically, once the Model is defined.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Nathan, thanks for the conmemt. I live in Alexandria, Virginia, about twelve miles south of DC. Technically, I"m in northern Virginia (which we call "NoVA," pronounced "nova"); NoVA is part of a region referred to as "the DC-Metro area," which includes northern Virginia, DC, and those parts of southern Maryland that touch DC.Sorry for any ambiguity. Long ago, I wrote a post on voting in which I made clear that, up to that point, I hadn"t voted, and that I considered not voting to be a perfectly legitimate move: if all the menu items are shit sandwiches, then you should leave the restaurant. I still believe that, but in recent years I"ve found myself moving outside of my own comfort zone and voting. This post was a joking look at how I seem to have changed.As is probably true in Canada, not all districts vote on the same matters at the same time. I guess that, where I live, the only pressing issues were various ballot measures. As for your questions regarding DC representation and voting, I found a Wikipedia entry that might answer you better than I can: .Hope this helps.Kevin</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Thanks for the nice words. You bring up good points. I would start by siggestung something I learned from Ruby: it"s relatively easy to make software run faster, but it"s rather hard to find more time for developers to do everything they need to do. In other words: maybe making something easier to develop even if that means it"s slower to run is a perfectly reasonable argument. But if you don"t like that one, the solution in these situations is to cache, cache, cache. For example, schema caching alone in Yii will drop those first two queries. The other two are common on any paginated result set.I wouldn"t, however, say this teaches horrendous coding practices as I don"t think people would get to this point of seeing how a framework works without having first learned how to do it the manual way, as you have.</p>

<p xml:lang="eng">Hello Yajasi,I do not think that Internal Server Error can be because of error in Javascript file but still we used fnloowilg script file with my codeThis works fine for us. Try changing your minimized file with this one and check if its works or not.a0In step 5, a0we have not changed the Id. Please refer to Step 4 line 13, here we have assigned a class to anchor tag, class with value some thing like editable_x where x is database id of user. In step 5 line 5, we are getting value of that class, taking its substring to get user"s database id in order to send it to server along with other data.I hope this clears out the confusion.a0Like it? 0</p>
