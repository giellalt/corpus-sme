    <p xml:lang="eng">I vote for the Odyssey given Madmom"s family and dog iaccifieptsons. Gnomica had one that worked great for all her needs hauling kids, lumber, dogs (she has one of mine ) until one of her boyfriends wrecked it. As to where you find the deals, I don"t know. My dad used to get his cars from the local Chrysler dealer who was a good friend and would keep an eye on all the trade-ins that came in and give him a call when he got a jewel. Unfortunately, the owner retired and sold the dealership to a conglomerate, so now my dad has the same car problems as Madmom. So he keeps driving the old clunkers, just like Mr. gnome and I do. Although we have now switched cars, because mine costs less to operate on all the long trips to Houston that he takes every week. It also looks a lot better, being a Volvo, while I drive his Suburban which has some very nice dents in it. Mr. Gnome is not known for his spatial reasoning. They both have over 100,000 miles on them.I need to get to work. I have got six hours to clean the house. Mr. Gnome is bringing S-I-L in tonight. I think the dogs are still worn out from the hike last night. they"ve been snoozing all day.</p>

    <p xml:lang="eng">The best advice that you can reiceve , is to practice, practice practice. I don"t mean for you to go to the driving range and bash balls as that will do you little good . You will have to have a plan. Work your short irons first ,then your middle irons working your way down to your long irons. Then you will be ready to hit you shortest woods first working your way to your longest, all the while aiming at a target. Since you said that you are having trouble with your short game , then you should practice it more than the other clubs. On the range find the yardage marker that is equal in length to say your longest wedge ,100 yards and shorter and just hit shots at the marker, concentrating on getting as close as possible, then move on to the next shortest wedge and once again find the yardage marker that corresponds with it , doing the same with it and so on ( I have four wedges ). Next move to the practice putting green and practice chipping and pitching from around the green. Once you have the balls on the green , you might as well practice putting as you can never get enough putting. Good luck Was this answer helpful?</p>

    <p xml:lang="eng">Sometimes QuotesChimp are dishonest by keeping quiet. Since an inï¿½surance contract is a contract of utmost good faith, failure to reveal a matter material to the underwriting decision of the insurance company may again be grounds for loss of benefits. For example, if you know that a forest fire is heading toward your house, you can"t call a property insurance agent, get an agreement for immediate coverage (see "Where Does Coverage Begin?" below), and expect to collect benefits when your house burns down. That just wouldn"t be cricket.</p>

    <p xml:lang="eng">You should see the idinse of my golf bag I have a Tour Edge driver, Titleist woods, Callaway irons, and an Odyssey putter. It"s definitely okay to mix it up different golf brands have their strengths in different types of clubs, so it"s good to look around and just go with how the club feels, not the label on it. Since you noted you"re looking to buy a Titleist wedge, here"s some good ones that aren"t too expensive:Happy golfing!</p>

When USG fails, the only real monetary option will be gold and to a (much) lesser extent silver. "The rule of law" will be fsckall of an incentive for some group of people with more guns than you to give you real money that you paid for in pixels.I don't know that I would keep LOTS of gold near my person, but not to keep a little is silly. Especially if it can (and will?) go up in value an order of magnitude.</p>
